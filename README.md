# Supporting Information: *"On the continuous modeling of fluid and solid states"*

This repository is part of the Supporting Information of the article *On the continuous modeling of fluid and solid states* by Gustavo Chaparro and Erich A. MÃ¼ller. Preprint available [here](https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2024-tjfj7). In this article, an equation of state based on artificial neural networks (FE-ANN(s) EoS) that continuously models fluid and solid states is presented. This EoS is showcased for the Mie particle.


$$ \mathcal{U}^{\textnormal{Mie}} = \epsilon  \underbrace{\left[ \frac{\lambda_r}{\lambda_r- \lambda_a} \left( \frac{\lambda_r}{\lambda_a}\right)^{\frac{\lambda_a}{\lambda_r - \lambda_a}} \right] }_{\mathcal{C}^{\textnormal{Mie}}} \left[ \left(\frac{\sigma}{r}\right)^{\lambda_r} -  \left(\frac{\sigma}{r}\right)^{\lambda_a} \right] $$

Here, $\mathcal{U}^{\textnormal{Mie}}$ refers to the interaction energy between two Mie particles, $\epsilon$ is the energy scale, $\sigma$ is the shape parameter, which is related to the particle's diameter and $r$ is the center-to-center distance. Finally, $\lambda_r$ and $\lambda_a$ are the repulsive and attractive exponents.

### FE-ANN(s) EoS 

The FE-ANN(s) EoS models the residual Helmholtz free energy as follows.

$$ A^{\textnormal{res}} = \textnormal{ANN}(\chi, \rho, 1/T) - \textnormal{ANN}(\chi, \rho=0, 1/T) $$

Here, $A^{\textnormal{res}}$ is the residual Helmholtz free energy, $\rho$ is the density, $T$ is the absolute temperature, and $\textnormal{ANN}$ refers to an artificial neural network. Finally, $\chi$ are the descriptors of the molecule (or pseudo-molecule) of interest, e.g., the molecular parameters of an interaction potential. In this work, the use of the FE-ANN(s) EoS is showcased for the Mie particle; in this case, the $\alpha_{vdw}$ is used as the molecular descriptor.

$$ \alpha_{\textnormal{vdw}} = \mathcal{C}^{\textnormal{Mie}} \left( \frac{1}{\lambda_a - 3} - \frac{1}{\lambda_r - 3}\right)  $$

The FE-ANN(s) EoS has been trained using first- and second-order derivative properties of the Mie particle. The following thermophysical properties are considered: compressibility factor, $Z$, second-virial coefficient, ${B}$, internal energy, ${U}$, isochoric heat capacity, ${C_V}$, thermal pressure coefficient, ${\gamma_V}$, isothermal compressibility, as ${\rho\kappa_T}$, thermal expansion coefficient, $\alpha_P$, adiabatic index, ${\gamma=C_P/C_V}$, and the Joule-Thomson coefficient, ${\mu_{JT}}$.
